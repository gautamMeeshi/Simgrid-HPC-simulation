1. Learn tracing. Have to find the network behavior.
   Whether the remote execution signal traverse through links?
   If so then we need to create a lock for remote execution signal.
2. Learn tracing using R for simgrid.
3. Note down the simgrid trace options.
4. Scheduler support to SlurmCtlD process to be provided.
5. Power model and configuration tuning has to be Done.
6. The topology of interconnection network to be studied and modeled.
