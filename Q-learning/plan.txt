NOTE: the execution path should be root dir

1) Generate jobs, move the job file to the input/jobs/ dir - DONE
    python3 job_creator.py
    mv utils/jobs_created.csv input/jobs/jobs{counter}.csv

2) Run both fcfs_backfill and remote_qnn scheduling algorithms, - DONE
   note the energy consumption
    make run SCHED=fcfs_backfill JOB_FILE=jobs{counter}.csv
    
    Read the total energy consumption, time taken
    
    make run SCHED=remote_qnn JOB_FILE=jobs{counter}.csv
    
    Read the total energy consumption, time taken

    If the EDP of the qnn is better then copy the jobs{counter}.csv and run_log{counter}.csv to improvements
    
    cp input/jobs/input.csv improvements/
    cp output/run_log.csv improvements/run_log{counter}.csv

3) Train the neural network on each of the improvements pair



finally run 100 random jobs compare the result

Required files
    1) File to generate 100 job files
    2) File to run the job files and store the difference
    3) File to train the neural network on the logs present in improvements folder
